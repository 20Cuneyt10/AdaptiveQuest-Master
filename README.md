\# Adaptive Quest



Adaptive Quest is a questing mod for Minecraft Forge.  

The idea is simple: instead of just playing survival with no direction, this mod gives you a quest system that actually works across different versions of the game.  



\## what it does

\- adds a quest framework where you can define and track quests  

\- comes with its own quest and stats screens so you don’t need to type commands just to see progress  

\- keybinds for quick access to menus (y for opening the guı)

\- server and client stay in sync so everyone sees the same progress  

\- works on multiple versions (right now 1.18.2, 1.20.1, and 1.21)  

\- has configs if you want to tweak how it behaves  





\## how to install

1\. download the version that matches your minecraft  

2\. drop the jar into your mods folder  

3\. run the game with forge installed  



\## building from source

clone the repo, open a terminal inside it and run:



./gradlew build



you’ll find the finished jar inside `build/libs`  



\## plans for later

\- more quest types like kill quests, gather quests, exploration  

\- shared quests so players can do them as a group  

\- better reward options  

\- maybe even an in-game quest editor
